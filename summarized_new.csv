Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kashmir in April will be his third since he assumed office in May. ""The prime minister will be in (the Indian Kashmir summer capital) Srinagar to flag off the first bus on April 7,"" Singh's spokesman said. The bus service is the first tangible result of 14 months of dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours who have fought three wars including two over Kashmir, which each hold in part but claim in full. India and Pakistan agreed last month that Kashmiri residents would not need passports to cross the divided state by bus but would use permits issued by the civil administration after being cleared by police. The bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first India-Pakistan war over Kashmir. The second was in 1965. Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that has so far left thousands dead. India blames Pakistan for fomenting the insurgency in Kashmir which has left at least 40,000 dead according Indian estimates, though separatists put the toll at twice that number. Pakistan denies supporting the rebels though it admits to extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris' freedom struggle. Indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been issued to applicants from Indian-Kashmir to travel by the bus linking Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan-administered zone. Of the 150 applicants, 60 will be short-listed for the first two trips -- the first on April 7 and the second a fortnight later -- an official said.",Indian and Pakistani military commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir in violation of a 14-month ceasefire.

Bangladesh,"Crying, waving and throwing letters wrapped around stones to eachother, hundreds of Kashmiris gathered on either side of a river thatseparates the disputed Himalayan region between Pakistan and India. The emotional reunion Wednesday across the Neelum River came on thefinal day of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr _ and as Indian PrimeMinister Manmohan Singh paid a rare visit to Indian-controlledKashmir, his country's only Muslim-majority state. Families separated for decades by the Kashmir conflict shoutedgreetings over the noise of the fast-flowing river. Despite easingtensions between South Asia's nuclear rivals, Kashmiris are stillforbidden from crossing the watery border. Nosheen Akhtar, 22, and her mother, Khonshad Begum, 40, burst intotears, wailed and beat their chests _ unable to meet Begum's motheron the Indian side. ""I want to jump into the river. My mother is there and I cannot goover to meet with her,"" said Begum, her relatives holding her back. Authorities on both sides were restricting access to the riverside atKarin, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the capital ofPakistan-held Kashmir. Indian soldiers were preventing people fromgetting too close, and on the Pakistan side, police said authoritieshad not given formal permission for the reunions. The Pakistani and Indian portions of Kashmir are separated by aheavily militarized cease-fire line where skirmishes were once commonbetween their forces. The guns have fallen silent for the past yearamid the thaw in relations, and since then there have been severalopportunities for family reunions _ albeit at a distance of 25 meters(yards) across the river. Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety and have foughttwo wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947.The conflict has only deepened since an Islamic insurgency began onthe Indian side in 1989. India accuses Pakistan of helping foment it,which Pakistan denies. Some Kashmiris have fled from the Indian tothe Pakistan side, accused of involvement with the rebels. On Wednesday, Singh, the Indian leader, expressed a commitment tomake peace with Pakistan, while Islamabad hailed India's withdrawalof some of India's troops in Kashmir _ a move hoped to spur the peaceprocess. But Kashmiris are impatient for progress that will allow them toreunite with relatives across the cease-fire line, known as the Lineof Control. The two countries are due to start formal talks on Kashmir nextmonth, and people on both sides are eager for a long-standingproposal for a bus service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, thesummer capital of Indian-held Kashmir, to finally get off the ground. ""Both the countries have not been allowing us to meet,"" said RajaAzhar Khan, a 55-year-old refugee, whose wife and son live on theIndian side of the Neelum River. ""The two countries are getting friendly. They are allowing people tomeet each other at Wagha (the main land border between Indian andPakistan). Why are we Kashmiris not being allowed to meet?""","Crying, waving and throwing letters wrapped around stones to eachother, hundreds of Kashmiris gathered on either side of a river thatseparates the disputed Himalayan region between Pakistan and India.
